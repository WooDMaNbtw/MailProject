# MailProject

### This C# code defines a mail management system with functions for adding mail entries, searching for mail by sender's name or cost, and displaying the mail database. It uses a MailDB struct to represent mail data and a Mail class to manage the mail database. The program can load and save data from/to a text file, allowing users to interact with the mail database through a console-based menu system.
